# Scheduler Slack Bot

This is a small utility I wrote for my colleagues at a former employer of mine. We'd get our weekly work schedule sent to us via Slack in plain text. This bot integrates with Slack and converts the message to an `.ics` file, which can then by imported to the user's Calendar app on their phone or computer.
